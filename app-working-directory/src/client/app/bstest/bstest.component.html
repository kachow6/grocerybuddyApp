<p>This is the NGX Bootstrap test page. It's here to make sure everything actually works (pray to God), so we can actually start development on Monday.</p>

<div>
  <div class='wrapper'>
    <div class='container' [dragula]='"first-bag"'>
      <div>You can move these elements between these two containers</div>
      <div>Moving them anywhere else isn't quite possible</div>
      <div>There's also the possibility of moving elements around in the same container, changing their position</div>
    </div>
    <div class='container' [dragula]='"first-bag"'>
      <div>This is the default use case. You only need to specify the containers you want to use</div>
      <div>More interactive use cases lie ahead</div>
      <div>Make sure to check out the <a href='https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula#readme'>documentation on GitHub!</a></div>
